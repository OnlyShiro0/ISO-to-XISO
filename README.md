# ISO-to-XISO

This is a code to transform those ISO's into XISO's files.

-You just need to write this down in a bat file:

- Create a txt and and put the code below
- Save it as a .bat file
- Once you have this finished you just need to go to the repo attached below and download it.
- Now once you have it done, just put all together like:
Xbox_ISOs
├── extract-xiso.exe
├── extract_xiso.bat
├── Halo.iso
├── Black.iso

and this will automatically separate the document from ISO, assigned to DUMP file and the new XISO's to the XISO file.

(note: the .exe already helps to make this, but makes one at the time. The purpose of this .bat is to helps to automatize the process. so if u have multiple ISO's can be done at once.
