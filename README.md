# ISO-to-XISO

so, recently I've been trying figured it out how to get XISO. digging through the posts and some help of ChatGPT since I don't have too much idea about programming in .bat files, I found the way you can transform those ISO's into XISO's files.
I will leave y'all the code. so, you just need to write this down in a bat file - creating a txt and saving it as a .bat file -. once you have this finished you just need to go to the repo attached below and download it. now once you have it done, just put all together like:
Xbox_ISOs
├── extract-xiso.exe
├── extract_xiso.bat
├── Halo.iso
├── Black.iso

and this will automatically separate the document to a DUMP file and the new XISO's to the XISO file.

(note: the .exe already helps to make this, but makes one at the times, and the .bat helps to automatize the process. so if u have multiple ISO's can be done at once.
